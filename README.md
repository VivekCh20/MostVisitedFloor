# MostVisitedFloor

As a facility manager at a corporate office building, you are responsible for monitoring employee visits, their floor preferences, and resource usage. The office consists of multiple floors, each equipped with various resources such as desks, computers, monitors, and other office supplies.

You have a database table named "EmployeeVisits", which logs employee visits to the building. Each record in this table represents a single visit by an employee and includes details such as the employee's name, the floor they visited, and the resources they used during that visit.

Task:
Write an SQL query to retrieve the total number of visits, the most frequently visited floor, and a list of resources used by each employee. Display the results in ascending order of employee name.
